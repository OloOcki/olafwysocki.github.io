I know, there are many websites in the Internet and on GitHub itself about open data.

However, I would like to present my own list of open data sources which I, personally, find useful. Most of them are also tested by me. So...

*(last list update 27.03.2020, **list not completed yet**)*

There you go:

## **Global**
-[USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/usgs-eros-archive-digital-elevation-shuttle-radar-topography-mission-srtm-non?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects) - DEM (Digital Elevation Model) SRTM (The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) dataset with grid ~90m or ~30m
-[GEOFABRIK](https://www.geofabrik.de/) - gathers data from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) and yields .shp files packages for different regions/countries
- [Copernicus Global Land Service](https://land.copernicus.eu/global/products/sa) Surface Albedo (1km grid), TOC Reflectance, Land Surface Temperature (5km grid)
-[Global Soil Regions Map](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/use/?cid=nrcs142p2_054013)
## **Europe**
#### **DEM/DSM:**
-[Copernicus, EU-DEM (aka European Digital Elevation Model (EU-DEM), version 1.1)](https://land.copernicus.eu/imagery-in-situ/eu-dem/eu-dem-v1.1?tab=metadata)  - DSM (Digital Surface Model) dataset with grid 25m
#### **Environment:**
- [Air pollutant concentrations at station level (statistics)](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/air-pollutant-concentrations-at-station) - data from 2010 to 2016 (annual) registered at stations across Europe, stations with location and registered pollution amount
- [Global Roads Open Access Data Set (gROADS)](http://www.ciesin.columbia.edu/confluence/display/roads/Global+Roads+Data) - one standarized dataset of roads, ~50m positional accuracy, topologically integrated, suitable for mapping at an approximate scale of 1:250,000, focused on roads between settlements (not streets)
##### **Energy:**
- [EnergyMap](http://www.energymap.info/map.html)

The NSW (New South Wales) Government and CSIRO's Data61 launched an initiative called 'digital twin'. The Esri technology serves as backbone of the project.

Is this a new chapter in the digital twin technology?

Probably yes, as it offer an open platform which enables visualisation of 3D and 4D data (time). This means that one can load georeferenced model (BIM!) to the portal and see how it fits to the urban and natural environment ([check out one of the model](https://nsw.digitaltwin.terria.io/?utm_campaign=Oktopost-GIS+in+Local+Government&utm_content=Oktopost-linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_profile=Oktopost-Esri+Australia&utm_source=linkedin&utm_tags=Oktopost-FY19_LGT&fbclid=IwAR2tVLeUqJh9jB_ERONSTfiEkil7Q2IFB-ZkZBC1CcKKBsvy8m765Rk4--Q#share=s-poe5F0prldOMSADxyxXxqF1uBc1)). 

For now, you can test funtionalities of the NSW Spatial Digital Twin for "only" Western Sydney area. Few BIM objects are delivered by NSW as default models.

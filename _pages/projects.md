## Save the Cyclists

Besides being a very popular means of transportation across EU, cycling comes with its risks. In the EU there are more than 2000 people who become victim of fatal accidents involving bikes. One of the most dangerous cities in Europe is Berlin where 5191 cyclists were involved in accidents and 11 of them were killed in 2018. I calculated these numbers using a GIS software based on "Unfallatlas" data which is maintained by The Federal Statistical Office.

This project was created together with HERE company.

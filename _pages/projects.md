## Echoes of Breslau in Wroclaw

Walking down the street, we often do not draw attention to what architectural elements we pass by. It is interesting, but when we start looking around, we will see a lot of objects next to which we have passed by indifferently.

This is the case of the remains of the times when the city was called Breslau. Only objects from this period were taken into account during mapping. What's more, two classes of objects have been distinguished and classified: Footprints and Inscriptions in Breslau.

It was decided that the class Napisy in Breslau will be able to assign such attributes as the address, the purpose of the inscription, on what surface and from what material was made, the date of acquisition, the height at which the object is located, the content and translation of the text on the graphic or the state of preservation.

Traces of fights are primarily an indicative number of traces per address point, address, height at which the object is located, date of acquisition.

An important element for both classes is the photograph of a phenomenon that visualizes spatial information and facilitates its location in the field.
